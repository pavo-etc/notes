I coincidentally met two kids in their late teens/early twenties sharing a room at some weekend seminar. One was a brunet with a mushroom cut and glasses, the other had tousled blonde hair, wore a turtle neck and jeans. They were kind of hip kids, making lo-fi websites and lo-fi music. Their main website had a pink background with yellow links. One of the them linked to http://wienhtml.at/.<br />
They had all kinds of short, self hosted videos on it, where they played little songs together with different instruments.
</p>
<p>Despite our age difference, we got along instantly and started jamming on a mandolin and some hacked hardware. We had a really good time.
<p>
We went outside and they started riding on tiny skateboards, barely as large as one of their feet.<br />
They pulled the tiniest tricks with them - ollies, short grinds, tiny kickflips.<br />
Back in the room I said that I'd have to go and we exchanged numbers to stay in touch.

<p>
I woke up, opened my eyes and wondered who they were. I couldn't distinguish if they were real or not. It felt like I remembered them from some real life event...<br />
I was determined to look them up in my address book, but realised I didn't have their name.
</p>
<p>Drifting away again, I appeared in a dark seminar room, night lit through the slits of the shades covering a large window. The kid with the mushroom cut sat at a desk right next to me. I could only make out their silhouette, but I knew it was them.</p>
<p>'Hey again.' I said, 'It's been cool to hang out with you last weekend. Thanks for putting up with this grumpy old man. What's your name?'</p>
<p>They smiled and said: 'Fabian Delursi.'</p>
